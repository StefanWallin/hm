# Installation
I assume you use OS X since this is a React Native iOS application.
* Install XCode
* Install homebrew
* Install nvm
* `nvm install node && nvm alias default node`
* `brew install watchman` We recommend installing watchman, otherwise you might hit a node file watching bug.
* `npm install -g react-native-cli`
* `git clone git@github.com:StefanWallin/hm.git`
* `cd hm/HM`
* `open ios/HM.xcodeproj`
